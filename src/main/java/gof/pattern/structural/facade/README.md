## Facade Pattern

The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern that allows hiding the complexity of a subsystem by providing a simple interface for interacting with it. It enables client code to access a complex subsystem through a unified and simplified interface, making the usage of the subsystem more convenient and intuitive.

### Pattern Diagram

```
          Client
            |
            v
        Facade
            |
       Subsystem
            |  
   -------------------
   |      |       |   
Class1 Class2  Class3 
```

### Key Elements of the Pattern:

- `Client`: This is the class or module that uses the complex subsystem. The client does not interact directly with the classes inside the subsystem but communicates only with the facade.

- `Facade`: This is the class that provides a simplified interface for interacting with the subsystem. It hides the complexity of the subsystem, offering the client a straightforward set of methods.

- `Subsystem`: This is the complex subsystem composed of multiple classes. The classes within the subsystem perform specific tasks and interact with each other. The facade unifies them and provides a simplified interface for working with them.

### Advantages of Using the Facade Pattern:

- **Reduced Complexity**: The facade allows hiding the details and complexity of the subsystem from the client code, making the client code more understandable and easier to maintain.

- **Improved Modularity**: The facade enables dividing the system into separate subsystems that can change independently of each other.

- **Enhanced Flexibility**: If there's a need to change the subsystem or add new features, it can be done within the facade without affecting the client code.

- **Improved Portability**: The facade isolates the client code from the subsystem's details, making the system more portable.

### Example Use Case:

One example of using the Facade pattern is creating an interface to a complex system, such as a library or API, where the facade provides a simple interface for using functions from the library without requiring knowledge of all its intricacies.

Feel free to explore the provided example code to see how the Facade pattern can simplify interactions with a complex subsystem.
