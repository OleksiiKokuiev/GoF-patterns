# Prototype Pattern

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that enables creating new objects by copying an existing prototype, preserving its initial state.

## Purpose

The Prototype Pattern allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, referred to as the prototype. This pattern helps avoid the overhead of creating objects from scratch and preserves the initial state of the object.

## Structure

- **Prototype Interface:** This interface declares a `clone` method that concrete prototypes must implement. The `clone` method allows creating copies of the prototype.
- **Concrete Prototypes:** These are classes that implement the prototype interface. They provide their own logic for cloning and customizing the copy.
- **Client:** This is the code that generates new objects by cloning prototype instances.

## Example

In our example scenario, we have implemented the Prototype Pattern for creating animal instances. The `Animal` interface defines the prototype with a `clone` method. The `Sheep` and `Cow` classes are concrete prototypes. The `Client` demonstrates how new animal instances can be created through cloning.

## Benefits

- **Reduced Duplication:** Eliminates redundant code for object creation and initialization.
- **Flexible Object Creation:** New objects can be generated by cloning prototypes, enhancing customization.
- **Preserved State:** Cloning maintains the initial state of the prototype, making it easier to create variations.

## Usage

1. Create a prototype interface or abstract class with a `clone` method.
2. Implement concrete prototype classes that implement the prototype interface.
3. In the client code, create instances of the concrete prototypes and clone them as needed.

## Limitations

- **Deep Copy Concerns:** Careful handling of deep copies is necessary when prototypes contain references to other objects.
- **Complexity:** Cloning complex objects may require meticulous implementation to ensure accurate copying.
