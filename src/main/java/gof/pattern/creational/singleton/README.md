## Singleton Pattern

**Intent:**
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

**Motivation:**
In some scenarios, it is necessary to ensure that a class has a single instance throughout the application's lifecycle. For example, when dealing with configuration objects, connection pools, or global logging systems, having only one instance is essential for proper resource management.

**Structure:**
The Singleton pattern consists of the following components:
- **Singleton:** This class manages the single instance and provides a static method for accessing it. It ensures that only one instance is created.
- **GetInstance():** A static method in the Singleton class that returns the unique instance. If the instance does not exist, it creates one; otherwise, it returns the existing instance.
- **Instance:** The single unique instance of the class, stored as a static member variable within the Singleton class.

**Implementation:**
The Singleton pattern can be implemented in different ways, such as Lazy Initialization, Eager Initialization, or Thread-Safe Initialization, depending on the specific requirements of the application.

**Lazy Initialization:** The unique instance is created only when it is first requested through the GetInstance() method, saving resources until the instance is needed.

**Eager Initialization:** The unique instance is created when the class is loaded, ensuring it is available from the start.

**Thread-Safe Initialization:** In a multi-threaded environment, techniques like double-checked locking, volatile variables, or static holder class idiom can be used to ensure only one instance is created.

**Consequences:**
The Singleton pattern provides the following advantages:
- **Global Access:** A Singleton instance is globally accessible, allowing components to access it easily.
- **Resource Management:** It ensures that only one instance of a resource-intensive class is created, helping with resource management and optimization.
- **Controlled Access:** The Singleton pattern allows fine-grained control over the instantiation of a class, especially when the class requires restricted access.

**Note:** Use the Singleton pattern judiciously as it can introduce tight coupling and make unit testing more challenging. Consider the application's requirements and whether a single global instance is truly necessary before applying this pattern.
