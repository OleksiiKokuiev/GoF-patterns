The "Factory Method" pattern is one of the design patterns described in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" (often referred to as the "Gang of Four" or GoF). This pattern falls into the category of "Creational Patterns" and provides an interface for creating objects while delegating the actual creation process to subclassing classes. This allows classes to create instances of subclass objects.

The structure of the "Factory Method" pattern includes the following components:

1. Product: This is an abstract class or interface that represents objects created by the factory method. Subclasses of the Product class define specific types of objects to be created.

2. ConcreteProduct: This is a concrete class that implements the Product interface. Each ConcreteProduct corresponds to a specific type of object.

3. Creator: This is an abstract class or interface that declares the factory method for creating products. This method returns an object of type Product. Subclasses of the Creator class implement the factory method to create specific products.

4. ConcreteCreator: This is a concrete class that implements the factory method to create a ConcreteProduct. Each ConcreteCreator creates its own type of product.

Advantages of using the "Factory Method" pattern include:

- Separation of responsibilities: It allows separating the object creation process from their usage, making the code more flexible and maintainable.
- Extensibility: It allows adding new types of products without modifying the existing object creation code.
- Abstraction: Client code works with an abstract interface, independent of specific product classes.

An example of implementing the "Factory Method" pattern can be found in many libraries and frameworks, where they provide interfaces or abstract classes for creating objects, and concrete implementations are provided by different subclasses depending on the needs of the client code.
