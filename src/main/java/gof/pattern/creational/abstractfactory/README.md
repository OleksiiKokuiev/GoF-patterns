# Abstract Factory Pattern

The **Abstract Factory Pattern** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It falls under the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns and is often used to ensure that the created objects are compatible with each other.

## Motivation

In software design, it's essential to create objects that work together seamlessly, especially in complex systems. The Abstract Factory Pattern addresses the problem of creating object families (sets of related objects) in a way that ensures compatibility and consistency.

## Structure

The key components of the Abstract Factory Pattern are:

1. **Abstract Factory**: This is an interface that declares a set of methods for creating abstract product objects (e.g., createButton(), createCheckbox()).

2. **Concrete Factory**: These are concrete implementations of the Abstract Factory interface, each of which can create a family of related concrete product objects (e.g., WindowsFactory, MacOSFactory).

3. **Abstract Product**: This is an interface for a group of related products (e.g., Button, Checkbox).

4. **Concrete Product**: These are concrete implementations of the Abstract Product interface (e.g., WindowsButton, WindowsCheckbox, MacOSButton, MacOSCheckbox).

## Benefits

The Abstract Factory Pattern offers several benefits:

- **Modularity**: The Abstract Factory Pattern promotes modularity by encapsulating the creation of related objects. It allows you to change the entire family of products by switching the concrete factory.

- **Consistency**: The pattern ensures that the created objects are compatible with each other, as they are all part of the same family.

- **Flexibility**: It makes it easy to introduce new families of products without modifying existing client code.
