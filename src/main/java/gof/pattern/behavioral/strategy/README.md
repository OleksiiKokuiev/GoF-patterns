# Strategy Design Pattern

The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each algorithm, and make them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Structure

The main components of the Strategy pattern are:

- **Context**: This is the class that has a reference to the strategy interface and maintains a reference to a concrete strategy. It delegates the work to the strategy object.
- **Strategy**: This is an interface, or an abstract class that defines the common interface for all concrete strategies.
- **Concrete Strategies**: These are the actual implementations of the strategy interface. They encapsulate specific algorithms and are interchangeable.

## Benefits

Using the Strategy design pattern offers several benefits:

- **Increased Flexibility**: Strategies encapsulate algorithms, allowing you to easily add, replace, or modify them without affecting the client code.
- **Improved Code Reusability**: Strategies can be reused across different contexts, promoting code reuse and reducing duplication.
- **Better Maintenance**: With strategies isolated in separate classes, changes to one strategy won't affect others, making maintenance more manageable.
- **Easier Testing**: Strategies can be tested independently, leading to better unit testing and more reliable code.
- **Reduced Conditional Complexity**: Replacing complex conditional statements with strategy objects simplifies the code and makes it easier to understand.

## Usage

The Strategy pattern is used when you want to:

- Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable without changing the client code.
- Encapsulate various behaviors in separate classes.
- Avoid conditional statements and improve code maintainability.
